This is a  coin toss game. This is my first attempt at a two player game using elements that I understand.

Your dom project must meet these requirements:

INSTRUCTIONS: Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (must be visual and use the DOM not the Console)
Hosted on Github pages


Must be a two player game (either against the computer or against another player)


A win state - a way for the player to win the game

High score can be considered a win state

A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game



A way to keep playing if the game is not over

Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost
