This is a DOM based coin toss game -- heads or tails built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Requirements were that the game must:

be a two player game (either against the computer or against another player)

contain a win state - a way for the player to win the game

contain a lose state - a way for the player to lose the game

A way to keep playing if the game is not over

Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost

TECHNOLOGIES USED

The main technologies used in this project were:

1. The Math.random function to randomize the toss outcome
2. Buttons and click events to move us through the stages of the game
3. CSS animation to make the coin image rotate as a click event

CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED

I struggled with seperating out the rounds for this project and deciding whether to embed my logic in if statements chronologically or to create seperate functions to begin rounds.

Figuring out how to control the alert messages--not showing up too soon even with the time outs

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

With more time, I would like to make the game more interactive by adding:

1. Sound effects to make the game a little more fun/dynamic
2. A thumb-flick or other animation features to making the toss event more 3-D
3. A way to statically display the rounds and score on the page instead of using alerts
